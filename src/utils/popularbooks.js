    viewDetails: `Harper Lee’s “To Kill a Mockingbird” remains one of the most powerful commentaries on race, justice, and morality in American literature. Set in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama, during the 1930s, the story is told through the eyes of young Scout Finch. Her father, Atticus Finch, a respected lawyer, defends Tom Robinson, a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Through Scout’s innocent yet observant narration, readers witness the harsh realities of prejudice, ignorance, and courage. The novel captures the loss of innocence as Scout and her brother Jem confront the unjust world around them. Atticus’s integrity and quiet heroism make him one of literature’s most beloved characters. Harper Lee’s masterful storytelling blends humor, warmth, and tragedy, creating a timeless narrative that challenges readers to reflect on empathy and human decency. The book’s moral message—that understanding others begins by “climbing into their skin and walking around in it”—resonates across generations. “To Kill a Mockingbird” is not merely a historical novel but a mirror held to society’s conscience.`

    category: "Dystopian",
    viewDetails: `George Orwell’s “1984” stands as a prophetic masterpiece exploring government surveillance, truth manipulation, and totalitarian control. The novel follows Winston Smith, a low-ranking member of the Party in Airstrip One (formerly Britain), where Big Brother’s watchful eyes and the Thought Police ensure absolute loyalty. Every citizen’s action and even thought are monitored, and history itself is rewritten to serve the Party’s agenda. Orwell’s bleak portrayal of a society stripped of individuality and freedom warns readers of the dangers of unchecked political power and propaganda. As Winston secretly rebels through forbidden love and thought, he learns that the cost of freedom can be devastating. Written in 1949, “1984” feels eerily relevant today, echoing themes of digital privacy, media distortion, and authoritarianism. Orwell’s creation of terms like “doublethink,” “thoughtcrime,” and “newspeak” has entered everyday vocabulary, symbolizing the manipulation of truth. “1984” is not just a dystopian story—it’s a moral and political warning, urging society to protect truth and human dignity at all costs.`

    category: "Classic",
    viewDetails: `“The Great Gatsby” by F. Scott Fitzgerald captures the glittering yet hollow world of the Roaring Twenties. The story follows Jay Gatsby, a mysterious millionaire known for his lavish parties, as told by his neighbor, Nick Carraway. Beneath the glamour of Long Island’s elite lies Gatsby’s deep yearning for Daisy Buchanan, the love he lost years ago. Through Fitzgerald’s poetic prose, the novel explores themes of obsession, wealth, illusion, and the corruption of the American Dream. Gatsby’s pursuit of Daisy becomes symbolic of humanity’s endless chase for fulfillment through materialism. The green light across the bay—always out of reach—remains one of literature’s most enduring symbols of hope and unattainable dreams. Fitzgerald’s sharp commentary on society’s moral decay makes “The Great Gatsby” a timeless reflection on love, identity, and ambition. Its haunting beauty and tragic ending ensure its place as one of the greatest novels ever written.`

    category: "Romance",
    viewDetails: `Jane Austen’s “Pride and Prejudice” remains a masterpiece of wit, romance, and social observation. The novel centers around Elizabeth Bennet, a spirited young woman who refuses to marry for convenience. Her clash with the proud and reserved Mr. Darcy leads to misunderstandings, revelations, and ultimately, love. Set in the English countryside of the early 19th century, the story explores themes of class, reputation, and personal growth. Austen’s sharp humor and psychological insight make her characters enduringly real. Elizabeth’s intelligence and independence broke the mold of literary heroines, while Darcy’s transformation from arrogance to humility showcases Austen’s belief in moral development. Beyond its romantic surface, “Pride and Prejudice” critiques the limitations placed on women and the societal obsession with wealth and status. Two centuries later, its dialogue, charm, and commentary still resonate deeply with readers around the world.`
